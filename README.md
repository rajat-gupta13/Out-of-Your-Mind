# Out of Your Mind

A game made during the Building Virtual World class Round 5.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
* Unity 2017.1
```

### Rules of the Game

A set of rules and a basic description of what the game offers.

* The game is a simple game built for the Omni, Fove with additional Makey-Makey inputs during our Round 5 in the BVW class.
* The prompt for the assignment was to build a fun and memorable experience for the guests with the ETC Festival in mind.
* The story in the game was that you were at the ETC Festival when you would be approached by a few students about a secret world.
* The world started off as a 70's themed game show where the main game was something similar to the Pyramid with different categories.
* As the first round got over, the game transformed into a cyber-matrix world that made you believe that you were in a simulation.
* As the simulation game ended, the world descended into chaos, revealing that neither of this is real and it is just some desperate graduate students that wanted to show their world at the Festival.

## Deployment

The game is being built for the Omni, Fove with support for additional inputs in Makey-Makey.
